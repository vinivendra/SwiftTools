# SwiftTools

This is a set of tools written in Swift that add some sugar and some small functionality.

Mainly meant for small projects and scripts, as almost nothing here has been extensively tested.

Some of it was originally developed for the [Gryphon](https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon) project.
